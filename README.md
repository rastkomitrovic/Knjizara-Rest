# Knjizara-Rest
REST Web service of my final exam project.
The project is a bookstore web application written in Kotlin.
Some points of improvement for now are to add either basic or OAuth 2.0 authentication,
improving the logic of storing data (more concretly the comments).
The project uses Spring framework with Spring Data JPA plugin.
